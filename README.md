# trialportfoliosite
Following a tutorial by DesignCourse, I designed and created a responsive portfolio site using Adobe XD, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This was my first time designing my website using Adobe XD and using front-end languages to build it. I plan to add animation, subsequent pages, and prototype the entire site using Adobe XD.
